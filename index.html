        <p>The rectus abdominis muscle, also known as the "abdominal muscle" or simply the "abs", is a paired muscle running vertically on each side of the anterior wall of the human abdomen, as well as that of some other mammals. There are two
          parallel
          muscles, separated by a midline band of connective tissue called the linea alba. It extends from the pubic symphysis, pubic crest and pubic tubercle inferiorly, to the xiphoid process and costal cartilages of ribs V to VII superiorly.The
          proximal attachments are the pubic crest and the pubic symphysis. It attaches distally at the costal cartilages of ribs 5-7 and the xiphoid process of the sternum.
          The rectus abdominis muscle is contained in the rectus sheath, which consists of the aponeuroses of the lateral abdominal muscles. The outer, most lateral line, defining the rectus is the linea semilunaris. Bands of connective tissue
          traverse
          the rectus abdominis, separating it into distinct muscle bellies. In the abdomens of people with low body fat, these muscle bellies can be viewed externally. They can appear in sets of as few as two to as many as twelve. Although, six is
          the
          most common.</p>

          Your arms contain many muscles that work together to allow you to perform all sorts of motions and tasks. Each of your arms is composed of your upper arm and forearm. Your upper arm extends from your shoulder to your elbow. Your forearm
          runs from your elbow to your wrist.
          Before learning about the different muscles, it’s important to understand the four major types of movement they’re involved in
          
          Flexion - This movement brings two body parts closer together, such as your forearm and upper arm.
          Extension - This movement increases the space between two body parts. An example of this is straightening your elbow.
          Abduction - This refers to moving a body part away from the center of your body, such as lifting your arm out and away from your body.
          Adduction - This refers to moving a body part toward the center of your body, such as bringing your arm back in so it rests along your torso.
