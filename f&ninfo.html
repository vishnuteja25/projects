        <p>Deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum), such as weights lying on the ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises in which all repetitions begin with dead weight. In most other lifts,
          there is
          an eccentric (lowering of the weight) phase followed by the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. During these exercises, a small amount of energy is stored in the stretched muscles and tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is
          not
          flexible beyond the range of motion.There are several positions one can approach when performing the deadlift, which include the conventional deadlift and sumo deadlift.
          Although this exercise uses the legs and hips as the primary movers, it can also be considered a back exercise.</p>

        <p>Cardio or cardio-respiratory exercise is physical exercise of low to high intensity that depends primarily on the aerobic energy-generating process."Aerobic" is defined as "relating to, involving, or requiring free oxygen",and refers to
          the use of oxygen to adequately meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism.Aerobic exercise is performed by repeating sequences of light-to-moderate intensity activities for extended periods of time.Aerobic exercise may be
          better referred to as "solely aerobic", as it is designed to be low-intensity enough that all carbohydrates are aerobically turned into energy via mitochondrial ATP production. Mitochondria are organelles that rely on oxygen for the
          metabolism of
          carbs, proteins, and fats.</p>
